<h1 align="center">A Justification of Intellectual Property</h1>
<br>
<p>
This essay was written for a class on Social and Political Philosophy. This paper discusses many historical, Lockean, Utilitarian, and Societal benefits
to the existence of Intellectual Property Rights. In my essay, I provide such arguments to support this claim as well as provide brief 
justifications against many of the arguments made against Intellectual Property Rights.

<br>
<p>The <a href="https://jsempgroup.rice.edu">Sempionatto Research Group</a> develops wearable biosensors that collect and analyze sweat, 
blood, and other biofluids to monitor the wearer’s health. These wearable sensors must be 
flexible and thus are made by screen printing the electrode design with a conductive ink. 
Since existing screen-printing machines are bulky and expensive, the electrodes used in 
these sensors are often screen-printed by hand, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and 
wastes a large amount of ink. The goal of this project is to build a desktop-sized printer 
that automates this process while minimizing wasted ink. The mid-year checkpoint that 
summarizes the work can be found at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2>Personal Contributions</h2>
<h3>Printed Circuit Board</h3>
<p>
  I independently designed and developed a printed circuit board (PCB) that utilizes various 
  circuit components and devices to control the automated printer. The PCB is a 4-layer board 
  that incorporates signal layers, a power plane, and a ground plane. The board incorporates 
  a Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller, which is able to drive the motors on the printer and manage 
  the user-interface. Additionally, the PCB contains various anti-electromagnetic interference 
  (EMI) and noise protection features, such as bypass capacitors and a dedicated ground 
  plane. Onboard Screw Terminals and Header Pins allow for the PCB to interface with external 
  systems such as the motors and user-interface.

<h3>Electronics Undercarriage</h3>
<p>
  I configured the layout of the Electronics Undercarriage, which is the plexiglass sheet used 
  to house the motor drivers and power supply, to maximize usable space while still remaining 
  under the allotted spatial design constraints. The configuration contains four motor drivers 
  - used to control the motors based on microcontroller input - that I specifically selected 
  for the motor driver’s high precision as well as for features such as opto-isolation and 
  differential signaling.

        This project is comprised of four team members: myself, 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-noonan-4179a6221/">Katie Noonan</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-ramsey-172b69220/">Bradley Ramsey</a>, 
        and <a href="https://webbhayden.com">Hayden Webb</a> (The latter 3 being Mechanical 
        Engineering Majors). The team is broken up into two subsections - Electrical and
        Mechanical - of which serve to prioritize tasks based on individual specializations. 
        As previously mentioned above in 'Personal Contributions', I created a custom PCB 
        that utilizes and interfaces with commercially available products to control the 
        Brushless DC Motors. The Mechanical Subteam, worked on the Computer-Aided-Design 
        (CAD) Drawing of the Printer and assembled the printer using the CAD Design.

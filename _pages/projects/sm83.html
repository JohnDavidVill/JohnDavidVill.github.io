<h1 style="text-align: center;">SM83 CPU Design</h1>
The SM83 CPU is the CPU found on the Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Color. The goal of this project 
is to reverse-engineer the SM83 CPU in Verilog to execute binaries in the SM83 Instruction Set 
Architecture (ISA). This project is a side project that I am working on to learn more about 
Computer Architecture and design.

<br>
Figure 1 shows the SM83 ISA that is being used to reverse-engineer the CPU.

The SM83 is a CISC CPU. For my implementation, a Finite State Machine (FSM) will be implemented in 
Verilog for the Control Unit to handle the multi-cycle operations. The Control Unit will consist of 
sequential logic that will utilize the combinational logic of the CPU decoder.

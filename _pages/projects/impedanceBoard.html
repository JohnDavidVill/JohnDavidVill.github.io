<h1 style="text-align: center;">Impedance Matching Test Board</h1>
My personal goal for this project was to learn how to use Altium EDA to design a Printed Circuit 
Board (PCB) whose traces are Impedance matched. This project was originally created as part of a 
class project, but I extended the scope of the project by designing the board using Altium’s 
Impedance Profile Tool. The purpose of the project was to route two differential pair wires on a 6 
Layer PCB. The two differential pair wires would go between two different signal layers. Another 
goal of the project was to test the PCB differential wires using HyperLynx SI/PI. 
<br>
<br>
The following were the major constraints of the project:
<ul>
    <li>Must follow the OSHPark 6 Layer PCB Manufacturing Guidelines</li>
    <li>Differential Traces must be Impedance Matched to 100 Ω (50 Ω Single Ended)</li>
    <li>The differential pair wires must have 4 Vias per individual wire</li>
    <li>The total wire length for each differential pair wire must be 6 inches</li>
    <li>Maximum undershoot and overshoot of 140 mV</li>
</ul>
<br>
Pictured below in Figure 1 is the PCB. The two differential pairs were intentionally designed to be 
perpendicular to prevent any electromagnetic interference between the two pairs.

Pictured below in Figure 2 is the Altium Impedance Profile. The profile was manually created around the 
OSHPark guidelines.

The following design considerations were taken into account.
<ul>
    <li>Perpendicular signal wires across layers to minimize crosstalk</li>
    <li>Curved signal turns instead of 90 degree signal turns</li>
    <li>Use of ground planes to mitigate EMI.</li>
</ul>

Figures 4 and 5 show the 2-D Electromagnetic Fields.

The following slides were used as the submission for the class project. The slides detail the design 
choices from the PCB and explain the HyperLynx simulation results.

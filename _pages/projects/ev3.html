<h1 align="center">Lego EV3 Robotics Presentations</h1>
<p>
    Below are 3 links for different presentations I previously created
    for different robotics summer camps. The camps were aimed at introducing
    robotics using Lego EV3 robots to 2nd to 7th graders. The presentations 
    contain different activities and challenges that can be done using the 
    Lego EV3. These presentations can also be used for general introduction  
    on how to use the Lego EV3 in an educational or competative setting. 
    The first two links are a pair and are meant for a week long camp. 
    The third link is for a two week long camp and is more comprehensive.

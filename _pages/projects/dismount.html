    The Rice University Mobility Safety Department is a department within Rice University 
    concerned with the safety of sidewalks, roads, and other paths found in and around the 
    university. As part of a rising concern due to increased crashes between people on bikes and 
    e-scooters with pedestrians, the Mobility Safety Department sought a way to upgrade from their 
    existing solution - dismount sandwich boards signs. These signs, while offering an easy solution 
    for raising awareness, are problematic due to theft, relocation, missing components, and low 
    visibility among inattentive individuals. The goal of this project was to create a safe and effective 
    way to alert people on bikes and e-scooters to dismount from their bike or e-scooter. The 
    solution of this problem was to build a sensor based system that would detect when a person on 
    a bike or e-scooter was entering a dismount zone and provide a visual and physical cue to alert 
    people to dismount from their bikes or e-scooters. The final presentation can be found at the 
    bottom of the page.

<h2>Personal Contributions</h2>
<h3>Electronics Design</h3>
<p>
    I independently designed and implemented the electronics system that utilized the input from the 
    sensors to output the cue for the user to dismount from their bike or e-scooter. The electronics 
    system consisted of an Arduino Uno, a self-made force sensor, and a light-based visual cue.
</p>
<h3>Software Programming</h3>
<p>
    I programmed the Arduino Uno to use analog data from the force sensor to control the visual 
    cue from the physical component of the solution. The Uno was programmed in such a way to 
    differentiate people on bikes and e-scooters from pedestrians using force distribution along 
    several force sensors distributed in series. The visual cue - a red LED strip - was programmed 
    to turn on when a bike or e-scooter was detected from sensor data.
</p>
<h3>Sensor Design</h3>
<p>
    I created a custom force sensor that was designed and fabricated using Velostat, a material 
    whose conductivity varies with applied force. This proprietary sensor was developed due to 
    limitations in the maximum force measurable by readily available, low-cost sensors, as well as 
    the high cost of existing sensors capable of measuring forces within the required range for this 
    application.

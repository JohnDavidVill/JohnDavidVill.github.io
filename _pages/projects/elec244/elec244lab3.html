<h1 style="text-align: center;">Lab 3: Amplifiers</h1>
Amplification is an important part of Electrical Engineering. Amplifiers are useful when 
dealing with small signals. There are various types of amplifiers that are used for 
various purposes. In this lab, you will explore Class B and Class AB Amplifiers.

<h2>Class B Amplifiers</h2>
Class B Amplifiers utilize two transistors. These transistors are an NPN and PNP 
Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT). The transistors used in this lab are the 2N3904 
NPN and 2N3906 PNP transistors. As shown in the circuit diagram in Figure 1, the collector 
of the NPN transistor is connected to +5 V, and the collector of the PNP transistor is 
connected to -5V. The bases of the transistors are wired together, and they connect to the 
input signal. The emitters of the transistors are wired together to form the output of the 
circuit. Note that for the purpose of the lab, the speaker has been swapped out for a resistor 
connected to ground.

The NPN transistor amplifies the positive part of the input signal, and the PNP transistor 
amplifies the negative part of the signal; however, the transistors do not perfectly amplify 
the input signal. As you can see in Figure 2, the output signal is zero near the zero-crossings 
of the input signal. This effect is known as the Crossover Distortion

Crossover Distortion occurs because BJT transistors require the Base-Emitter Junction to be 
Forward Biased by some voltage. This voltage is known as the Base-Emitter Voltage, V_BE. 
According to the datasheets for the 2N3904 NPN and 2N3906 transistors, conduction occurs when 
they are Forward Biased by 0.65 V. For the NPN transistor, this conduction occurs when the 
base is 0.65 V above the emitter, and for the PNP transistor, conduction occurs when the emitter 
is 0.65 V above the base. When the magnitude of the voltage drops below the V_BE, the transistor 
will Cut-Off and will pass a negligible current. This prevents the flow of current at this voltage 
level, which is why the transistors in the Class B amplifier topology have a flattened output 
voltage near zero crossings.

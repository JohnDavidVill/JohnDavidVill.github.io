<h1 style="text-align: center;">Voltage Regulation</h1>

Voltage Regulation is an important part in power design for electronic circuits as 
regulators are able to stabilize the voltage the circuits receive. This is especially 
important in high precision circuits where a stable power source is necessary for the 
circuit to operate properly. Voltage Regulators maintain a steady DC voltage within the 
regulator’s operating range.


<h2>Building a Voltage Regulator</h2>
Figure 1 shows the Voltage Regulator Circuit that is constructed in Lab 4. The key elements 
of the circuit are resistors, Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT), a Zener Diode, and an Op-Amp. 
These components are connected in a specific topology to create the Voltage Regulator.

<h3>Reference Voltage</h3>
The Zener Diode is used to create a reference voltage. As noted in Horowitz and Hill’s The 
Art of Electronics<sup>1</sup>, “When [a zener diode is] connected in parallel with a variable 
voltage source so that it is reverse biased, a Zener diode conducts when the voltage reaches the 
diode's reverse breakdown voltage. From that point on, the low impedance of the diode keeps the 
voltage across the diode at that value.” The Zener Diode in Figure 1 is in parallel with the 
rest of the circuit, meaning that the diode is providing a reference for the Op-Amp and BJTs to use. 
According to the 1N5226 Zener Diode Datasheet<sup>2</sup>, the zener diode that is used in this 
circuit has a nominal Zener (Breakdown) Voltage of 3.3V at 20 mA. While this value differs from what 
is found in practice, it dictates the reference voltage for the rest of the circuit. It is important 
to note that Zener Diodes often require a bias current. In the circuit diagram shown in Figure 1, the 
R3, 10 kΩ resistor is required to put the Zener Diode in breakdown mode.

The rest of this section is under construction. Check back soon for updates!

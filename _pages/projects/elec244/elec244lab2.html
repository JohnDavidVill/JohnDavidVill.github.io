A major characteristic of Op-Amps is their Slew Rate. The Slew Rate of an Op-Amp is the 
maximum rate of change of the output voltage with respect to time. I.e.

<div class="cent">
<div class="eq-c">
 Slew Rate = max(
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">dV<sub>out</sub></span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">dt</span>
  </div>
 )
</div>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Why Slew Rate is Important</h2>
Slew Rate is an important parameter in circuit design. If your circuit operates at high frequencies, 
you need to use an Op-Amp whose Slew Rate is rated above the frequency and amplitude you plan to use. 
For sinusoidal signals, your signal must satisfy the following condition to avoid Sine Wave Distortion:

<div class="cent">
    <div class="eq-c">
        Slew Rate ≥ 2πfV<sub>p</sub>
    </div>
</div>

Where f is the maximum frequency you plan to work with and V<sub>p</sub> is the Peak Voltage.

<h2>Why Op-Amps have a Slew Rate</h2>
Slew Rate can be understood by looking at the internal circuitry of the Op-Amp. If you look at the 
Functional Block Diagram of the LM741, you will notice that there is a 30pF capacitor (C1) within the circuit. 
This capacitor is known as the Compensation Capacitor.

This capacitor affects the area around it, and is one of the main causes of Slewing. If you have not buried 
the trauma of ELEC 241 or PHYS 102, you’ll remember that the current of a capacitor is given by:

<div class="cent">
<div class="eq-c">
 I = C
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">dV</span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">dt</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

If we rearrange the equation, we get the Slew Rate equation we defined above in terms of Output Current and Capacitance:

<div class="cent">
<div class="eq-c">
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">dV</span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">dt</span>
  </div>
 =
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">I</span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">C</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

This equation can be rearranged to:

<div class="cent">
<div class="eq-c">
  dt
 =
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">C</span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">I</span>
  </div>
  dV
</div>
</div>

And when integrated, the result becomes:

<div class="cent">
<div class="eq-c">
  Δt
 =
  <div class="fraction">
  <span class="fup">CΔV</span>
  <span class="bar">/</span>
  <span class="fdn">I</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

Since C and ΔV are fixed, and I is the maximum current, there is a minimum time it takes for the Capacitor 
Voltage to change by ΔV. This is one of the main reasons as to why the change in the Output Voltage of the 
Op-Amp is limited as it is restricted by the time its internal circuitry can change voltage.

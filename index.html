        For my Automated Biosensor Printer Project, I successfully tested, populated, and implemented 
        the printed circuit board into my team's system design. The board is my most ambitious and intrepid 
        PCB design yet, and I am happy to say that its implementation was successful.

        Once I received my printed circuit board from manufacturing, I tested the board for viability. 
        After ensuring proper board viability, I populated the board to fit the connections for our 
        microcontroller, integrated circuit chips, and output terminals.
